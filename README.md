## FAQ

### Which branch should I use?
- `stable`/`main`: Default branch and main release. This is **my recommend branch**.
- `draft`: Alpha branch. This branch is used for update my progress and it's very unstable. Use it at your own risk.

### I received error about login while running AccountTest?
- Did you mean this error: `dut_account environment variable not found. Please, add or modify this environment in format "username|password"`?
- If so, you will need to add environment variable named `dut_account` with syntax `studentid|password`.
